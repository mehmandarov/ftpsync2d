#ftpsync2d

This project provides a tool to synchronize remote FTP and local directory trees in both directions. The tool is provided as a Python script (ftpsync.py) that can be useful for uploading new/modified files to a homepage host using FTP. The tool can also be used to download new/modified files (such as wiki pages) for backup or mirroring purposes.

In both usage cases, the tool requires write access to FTP server to create .listing files that are used to accelerate the synchronization process.

##Download and installation

You can download the python script ftpsync.py from here. For installation, just copy the file to a directory that is in the PATH environment variable and make it executable (eg chmod +x ftpsync.py).

##Usage

To learn about the options of the ftpsync.py script, run

```console
sh> ftpsync.py --help
```

that will display

```console
Usage: ftpsync.py [options] <remote path> <local path>

 ftpsync.py is tool to synchronize remote and local directory trees using FTP
protocol (see http://ftpsync2d.googlecode.com/ for updates). Both directions
are supported. Write access to FTP server is required.  To skip processing
remote directories that one does not have read or write access, use --skip
option. When a new file was added to FTP server by other means than using
ftpsync.py, use --listing to update .listing files.  Remote path must be given
in the following form: [ftp://][username[:password]@]hostname[<remote
directory>]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --upload          enable uploading files
  -d, --download        enable downloading files
  -s SKIP_PATH, --skip=SKIP_PATH
                        skip listing specified remote (absolute) path
  -l, --listing         update remote .listing files
  -r REMOVE_PATHS, --remove=REMOVE_PATHS
                        remove specified files and directories
  -e, --export          only file export, no .listing files; will override all
                        functions modifying or creating .listing files
```

For example, to syncronize remote directory rdir in the FTP server ftp.example.com with the local directory ldir, run

```console
ftpsync.py ftp://ftp.example.com/rdir ldir --download
```

When username and password is required, the script will ask. When there are files that are changed locally and should be uploaded, add --upload option to the command line.
Important note

Before using ftpsync.py, backing up data is highly recommended.
